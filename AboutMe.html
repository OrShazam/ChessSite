<div class="main"> i enjoy learning new stuff and getting inspired by css tutorials and building this site was one of most fun things i've ever done, during trying to make stuff work i started getting better at solving problems, seperating confusing codes into simple and understandable parts and implicying creative ideas to my own site styling and scripting, i mean sure, code errors cause of keyboard slips can be very nerve-racking but you have to look at all those moments where you type something and it actually works, the satisfaction is simply divine. now let's get back to the about me thing, as i said i enjoy learning and one of my favorite sports is chess, if you couldn't tell so already by the site's theme, i also enjoy doing photo editing for the memes and mathematics, but one of my purest passions are system programming, handling data and managing everything with brilliancy requires accuracy and concentration which if you didn't notice already i love, i used to do a lot of drawings and reading but it's too old school for the 21th century, besides that there isn't much left to be said so i send you dear reader my farewells</div>
